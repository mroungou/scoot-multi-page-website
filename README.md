## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I would like to revisit this project later on and use react and other JS frameworks. Also would like to improve the mobile menu

### Useful resources
- [Flexbox MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - I have been using CSS Grid for a while now and sometimes feel it's overkill for what I needed to do. I have also avoided flexbox for a while as it wasn't as straightforward as Grid. I read the documentation and have gotten better at it.
